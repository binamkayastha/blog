# You Can Code

I remember the first week of freshman year, when I stumbled into Fuller Commons, the computer science lounge at WPI.

Pikachu: "So I was thinking of creating a thinclient, but like better."
Charmander: "Is that the thing where you use a powerful remote server to do things like play games via UDP instead of TCP?"
Pikachu: "Yeah, but I'm also going to try use googles BBR network."

Prof Oak: "Alright who here uses ubuntu"
Pikachu: "Actually I run Arch"
Charmander: "Ha! I use Gentoo"
Bulbasaur: "Squirtle runs their own linux kernel"
Emolga: "I want to make my own operating system with Rust :P"

Within the first few minutes, I realized two things:
1) I barely understood what anything anyone in that room was saying.
2) My goal by senior year was to be like these people.

For a long time it seemed like these people just had "it". They had some sort of genius gene that allowed them to just be good at everything they did. But over my four years at WPI, I realized that was flawed logic – because I achieved my goal.

I achieved it by eagerly asking the people in that room what everything meant. I joined ACM, the computer science club on campus. I went to their tech talks. I hung out with them whenever I could, and to be honest, I learnt more from that group of friends than I did in any course I took (and had a ton of fun on the way).

The more I thought about how I got there, I realized that I didn’t really get “smarter”. I just knew more things.

Intelligence: 'the ability to gain knowledge'
Knowledge: 'facts, information, and skills acquired by a person'
** Paraphrased from Google

During my junior and senior years at WPI I strongly wanted to transfer this nugget of wisdom to others. I wanted them to experience the same phenomenon that I had. I organized Hack@WPI (a hackathon) and saw people who never coded before create their own websites and mobile applications in two days. As a student assistant (SA), I spent more days extending my office hours past midnight than I'd like to admit. My proudest moments as a SA was seeing students figure out the solutions themselves – that’s the turning point where they go from gaining knowledge from me to learinging on their own.

The key to becoming a successful software engineer is to get to a point where you can give yourself knowledge.

But today, I'll show you how easy it is to make the first step. That's right, you'll learn how to code RIGHT NOW. So grab a laptop and let’s get started!

On Ubuntu:
gedit

On Mac:
Open TextEdit

On Windows:
Open Notepad

Type: “Hello World”
Save (but don’t close!) the file as: FirstWebsite.html (Make sure you know where you save it, I recommend Desktop for convenience)

In Finder or File Explorer, open FirstWebsite.html

It should automatically open in a web browser (like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari)

Congratz you created your first website!

Alright a website isn’t a website without an image.

Let’s go find an image:


Beautiful

Let’s edit FirstWebsite.html to be this:

Hello World!
<
img
src="https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/3q0UCAvO7eRSC9hKqIbMeVmtLIE=/617x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/nicolas-cage-mona-lisa-5798ce3d5f9b589aa975f7b7.jpg"
>

Save the file
Go back to your browser and click the refresh the button 

What’s going on here? Let’s go line by line:

1) <
This is the start of the image

2) img
`img` stands for `image`. Your browser knows that the everything within the arrow brackets (<>) are all things describing the image.

3)src="https://www.liveabout.com/thmb/3q0UCAvO7eRSC9hKqIbMeVmtLIE=/617x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/nicolas-cage-mona-lisa-5798ce3d5f9b589aa975f7b7.jpg"
`src` stands for `source` and the link is the image

4) >
This is the end of the image.



In this blog you have learned to:
 - Create an HTML file
 - View the HTML file in your web browser
 - Write some text
 - Display an Image

Some would argue that HTML isn’t really code, but at the end of the day you created a website! I hope that this will be a motivator for you to gain more knowledge and become a full-fledged coding ninja.

I urge you to continue doing tutorials like this one. Over time, you’ll gain enough confidence and knowledge to create your own project from your own ideas. Take as many baby steps as you need, and never give up. That’s all it really takes to be a coder, and I have no doubt in my mind that you can do it.
